# DecoratorDesignPattern
# In this design pattern, I had to use a driver to create code that would create 3 different types of Vehicles, and allow for 3 other types of modifications to be done to them as well. This code had to keep track of what Vehicle was ordered from the "Car Lot" and apply the correct modifications to that Vehicle. The output would generate what Vehicle was ordered, the description of it, and the total price after modifications.
